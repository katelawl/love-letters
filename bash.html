			<h2>Love Letter</h2>
	
			<h3 class="notcentered">
			My beloved <strong>Bash</strong>,
			</h3>
			<p>
			When I open your terminal I feel so happy to see your wonderfully beautiful, simplistic <strong>UNIX</strong> operating system. Sometimes I don’t know where we are in our relationship, but when I type <strong>PWD</strong> I can see the present working directory to find our exact relationship status. This is comforting, yet I do often need exact details of what our love consists of. But, yet again, when I type <strong>ls</strong> I can see a list of what directories are in our present directory and all of the reasons you love me. I am sorry for the time I wanted to change directories. I typed <strong>cd ~ </strong> to go back to the home directory, <strong>cd ‘directoryname’</strong> to go into a certain directory,<strong> cd / </strong> to go to the root of the computer, and<strong> cd ..</strong> to go back a directory. I was just lost and wanted explore different directories, but I realised there is only one for me and that is you <strong>Bash</strong>.</p>
			<p> I am so proud of the directory child we created together, <strong> mkdir</strong>. There is a little bit of you and a little bit of me in it and it is so beautiful. And then, we became grandparents when we <strong>touch </strong> a new file. When our directory lets us babysit that file we type <strong>nano ‘filename’</strong>, I feel like we are really editing that file to create a beautiful little grandfile. When our relationship is rocky I am confident we can work through it by typing <strong>help</strong> to see all of the built-in command that keep our love alive. And when I type <strong>clear</strong> we can forget our past history and move forward. If we are having communication problems, all I need to do is type <strong>echo</strong> to display a message on the screen and I then fully understand what you are saying. 
So thank you for everything you do for me.
</p>
<p>
Love,
</p>
