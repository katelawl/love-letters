			Dear <strong>Git</strong>,
			</h3>
			<p>
				I love the way you store file-based changes. Although you run through <strong>Bash </strong>, you have a mind and command of your own.  Here is a list of all the things I love about you.</p>
			<p> Why I love you…
			<br> 
<strong>git init</strong>- you initialize directories and create a .git directory out of nothing or an existing directory. You creativity is beautiful.
<br><strong>git add .</strong> or <strong>git add ‘filename’</strong>- you are preparing something to commit and make sure the files are updated with new content. You make sure everyone is updated which shows great organizational skills.
<br><strong>git commit -m “message”</strong>- you commit the files that are changed to save those changes. I love your commitment to our relationship.
<br><strong>git log</strong>- you keep track of all of the commit I make. This helps me keep track of all of our commitments.
<br><strong>git status</strong>- shows what branch the file is in, either the working, staging, or repository. This helps me keep updated on our status together.
<br><strong>git diff</strong>- this shows the difference between the files in working and repo branches. This helps me know what the difference between our relationship and my past relationships.
<br><strong>git rm</strong>- this allows me to remove file from repo. I can remove all of the bad things from our relationship
<br><strong>git mv ‘fileold’ ‘filenew’</strong>- this helps me rename files and know that our relationship is moving forward.
</p>
<p>
All of these things help me understand you more and grow my love for you. Thank you for being in my life <strong>Git</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Love,
</p>
