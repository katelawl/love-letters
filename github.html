			<h2>Love Letter</h2>
	
			<h3 class="notcentered">
			Dearest <strong>Github</strong>,
			</h3>
			<p>
			You are perfect for me because I can upload files to you and retrieve them from any computer. I first fell in love with you when I typed <strong>github.com</strong> and set up an account. That love blossomed when I first created a repository by clicking <strong>new repository</strong> and you told me exactly what to do to share my loving files with you. I can go into <strong>Bash </strong> and type <strong>git remote add origin https://github.com/’username’/’reponame’.git </strong> and <strong>git push -u origin master </strong>to upload a repository from my computer to you. You always keep my files safe. You are also very open about our relationship. Everyone can see my code and the <strong>commit</strong> we made together. You are kind and generous especially when you helped Professor Schaal’s lady friend get a job. We also have a very open relationship because you help me connect with other projects from people who upload their code. I can easily <strong>fork </strong> someone’s code and add to it. Thank you for keeping me connected to my code and other talented programmers code.
</p>
<p>
Love,
